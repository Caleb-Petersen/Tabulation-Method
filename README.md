# TabulationMethod
Reducing boolean functions is important because it reduces the number of gates that need
to be used in order to implement a function. There are several ways to reduce boolean 
functions: Karnaugh Maps, Logic Theorems (e.g. De-Morgans laws), and the tabulation method
(also called the Quine-McCluskey Tabular Method). It is an algorithmic in nature, and so 
it can be easily implement programmatically (as opposed to Karnaugh Maps which are very visual,
and logic theorems which can sometimes be complex to apply). This program is designed to take
in the number of variables in the boolean function as well as the minterms of the function, and 
output the reduced logic function.
